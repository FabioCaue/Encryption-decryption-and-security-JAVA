Basic security algorithms


AES:
 AES(Advanced Encryption Standard) can encrypt and decrypt informations using a common password of 128, 192 or 256 bits.
 I'm using a random 128 bits password in this case(16 bytes)
 *Useful for protect classified informations you'll need to bring back the original form later.
 *AES is a symmetric block cipher used by the U.S. government.	
MD5:
 Really useful for databases, the text encrypted by MD5 theoretically can't be decrypted then only the encrypted info would match the same result.
 *Better to store passwords in databases
 *Can be hacked only by forcebreaker and it can be impossible as well. 
 *Cannot be decrypted
